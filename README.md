# 3D Graphics Programming and Game Development in F#

Inspired by [Functional Programming In Games](https://github.com/Andrea/FunctionalProgrammingInGames) repository.

## OSS Projects
1. [F# Rendering Toolkit (Real-Time)](https://github.com/eloraiby/FsRTK/) - includes [Math3D](https://github.com/eloraiby/FsRTK/tree/master/FsRTK.Math3D)
2. [3D Math in F#](https://github.com/fsprojects/FsMath3D)
3. [F# GLFW 3.2.1 Binding](https://github.com/fsprojects/FsGlfw3)
4. [RayTracer F# Implementation](https://bitbucket.org/thedo666/raytracer/src/ad54e0b194b89547e7eeada119ac6a253b80a82b/RaytracerFSharp/?at=default)
5. [F# Ray Caster Implementation](https://github.com/ChrisPritchard/tiny-ray-caster)
6. [Shader translation from F# to HLSL](https://github.com/rookboom/SharpShaders)
7. [Duality Scripting](https://github.com/BraveSirAndrew/DualityScripting) Allows you to write F# on the Duality Game Engine (the compiler is integrated into the editor so you can write code on any editor you want). This plugin supports C# too.
8.[ Nu Game Engine](https://github.com/bryanedds/FPWorks) cross-platform F# 2D game engine. It encourages to use as the architecture a variation of FRP which he calls Iterative Functional Reactive Programming.
9. [FShade](https://github.com/krauthaufen/FShade) - a Library allowing users to write Shaders in F# using code-quotations.
10. [F# Doom](https://github.com/TIHan/NewFoom)
11. [F# Quake 3](https://github.com/TIHan/FQuake3)
12. [A collection of heightmap generators, along with some bmp/ppm image format savers](https://github.com/ChrisPritchard/Heightmaps)

2. [Asteroid Sharpshooter](http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Asteroid-Sharpshooter/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d80258550797) published on Xbox Live Indie Games, written in F#. [Slides on the development process](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1teGhBf-m7qRkMzsbCKvRcIEo-QLwdK9w8VOEWqu1qWQ/edit#slide=id.p). His [blog](http://sharp-gamedev.blogspot.co.uk/2011/03/asteroid-sharpshooter-post-mortem.html) has more information on how he made [F# work with XNA on Xbox 360](http://sharp-gamedev.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/xna).


Consider eventually consolidating with [Guide - Mobile App and Game Programming with F#](https://fsharp.org/guides/apps-and-games/)
